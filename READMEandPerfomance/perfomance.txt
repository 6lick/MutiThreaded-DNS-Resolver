The quickest run time occured with one requester and three resolvers. This is not what I expected, I expected 5 requester threads 
and the smallest amount of resolver threads to be the fastest. This was my assumption because with five requester threads each could service 
a file, once you exceed five the additional threads are just wasting cpu cycles. For the resolver threads I assumed the fewer the better since 
only one can be in the shared buffer at a time.
